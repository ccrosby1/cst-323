## Cloud Computing Research

 A. Read the assigned textbook required readings for this topic. Answer the following questions:
 
   1. What is a feature flag or feature toggle?
   
       - A feature flag, or feature toggle, is a technique that allows developers to enable or disable specific functionality in an application without deploying new code. It’s essentially a conditional switch in the codebase that controls whether a feature is visible or active. This makes testing features in production, rolling out changes gradually, or quickly disabling problematic functionality easy to do without requiring a full redeployment.
   
   2. What is A/B testing?
   
       - A/B testing is a method used to compare two versions of a product, feature, or interface to determine which performs better. Users are divided into groups, one that sees version A, and another that sees version B. Metrics such as click-through rates, conversions, or engagement are measured to identify which version provides better results.
   
   3. What is continuous delivery?
   
       - Continuous delivery is a DevOps practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to production. The key is that the software is always in a deployable state, even if not every change is immediately released. It's intended to reduce risk, shortens release cycles, and allows teams to deliver updates quickly and reliably whenever needed.
   
   4. What is continuous integration?
   
       - Continuous integration is a practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository. Each merge triggers automated builds and tests to detect integration issues early. The goal is to ensure that new code works well with the existing codebase, preventing conflicts and reducing bugs.
    
 B. One trend in cloud computing is the ability to develop code in a cloud and browser-based IDE. Research two viable existing cloud and browser-based IDEs on the market. How might these cloud-based IDEs conceptually be used to lower the cost of developing code for a company? What are some disadvantages or features that are missing in the IDEs you researched when comparing them to a desktop-based IDE, such as Eclipse or Visual Studio?
  
   - Two examples of cloud-based IDEs are GitHub Codespaces and Gitpod. GitHub Codespaces provides developers with a VS Code‑based environment that runs in the cloud and is tightly integrated with GitHub repositories. This integration allows teams to spin up standardized environments, eliminating the need for powerful local machines and reducing the time spent on onboarding or troubleshooting. Gitpod is an open‑source platform that automates the creation of ready‑to‑code environments directly from GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. It helps to reduce the time spent maintaining local setups and so more time can be spent writing code. Both platforms also have limitations compared to traditional desktop IDEs such as Eclipse or Visual Studio. Cloud IDEs require a stable internet connection, meaning offline development is not possible. They can also lag behind desktop IDEs in terms of advanced debugging and customization features, which may be important for some projects. There are other risks and considerations that come with cloud-based products in general. Things like outages or billing managment can directly impact development workflows.
 
 C. Complete a Scrum retrospective. Document the following:
    
   1. What worked well in this class? 
       
       - One thing that worked well in this class was the structure of the iterative assignment and milestone. Having the weekly activities built on each other, from creating the test app, to hosting it on different cloud providers, and finally implementing DevOps, made the process feel very natural and hands‑on. I found that starting the activities and milestones early in the week helped me manage my busy schedule, and the collaboration with my teammate on the group project was very effective. The class discussions in the DQ forums were also very active, which made it easy to participate throughout the week.
       
   2. What did not work well in this class?
              
       - What did not work as well were some of the instructions for the activities, which seemed outdated and occasionally difficult to follow. This felt especially noticeable with Azure and AWS. In addition, there were occasional technical issues related to account permissions. For example, I was unable to even create an account on Heroku due to restrictions.
       
   3. What would you like to see improved in the design of the class?
                 
       - For improvements in the design of the class, I think an update to the course materials would make a big difference, particularly since cloud providers seem to evolve quickly. Ensuring that guides reflect the latest interface and features would reduce confusion. I think it would also be valuable to expand the scope of the class to include other areas of cloud computing, such as serverless computing. Lastly, it would have been helpful to introduce DevOps a bit earlier in the course, allowing more time to gain hands‑on experience with the automated build and deployment process, particularly for the milestone project.
